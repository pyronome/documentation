Patterns are an essential element of Pyronome technology. Patterns are formed by bringing together the schemas -that shape the project model-, the static files, and the templates. Patterns can be based on other patterns, just like projects.

## My Patterns Page
This page lists the patterns you are a member of, or you have created. You can add new patterns or view your existing patterns on this page.

| Table Field | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| Name | This field shows the pattern title, the folder where the pattern is located and the pattern name. |
| Active Version | Pyronome allows users to create different versions of their patterns. This field refers to the version in which the user actively makes modifications to it. The active version can be changed via the **"Versions"** page of the pattern. |
| Enabled | This field indicates whether the pattern is enabled or not. Other members cannot view disabled patterns. |
| <i class="fas fa-users"></i> Members Button | Displays the **"Members"** page, which lists other members authorized to take action on the pattern. |

## Pattern Page
This page contains all the details of your pattern. From this page, You can manage the pattern schema, templates, model, and files.

### Overview Page
It is the first section displayed when you enter the project page. This page summarizes all the details regarding your project.

| Section | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| Basic Info | This table shows the basic information about the pattern. See [**"General Settings Page"**](#general-settings-page) for further details. |
| Patterns | This section lists the base patterns of the pattern. See [**"Patterns Page"**](#patterns-page) for details. |
| Dosyalar | This section shows the static files of the pattern. See [**"Files Page"**](#files-page) for details. |
| Versions | This section lists the pattern versions. For details, see [**"Versions Page"**](#versions-page). |
| Members | This section lists the pattern members. See [**"Members Page"**] (#members-page) for details. |
| Activity Log | This section lists the updates that are performed on the pattern by the members. |

### Schema Page
Patterns require specific fields and parameters to be defined by the user when creating the model. This section determines what fields and parameters to be defined by the user. Additionally, using this section, you can define a way to retrieve these fields and parameters from the user.

| Section | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| <i class="fas fa-history"></i> Commit History | When you update the schema, a copy of the schema is saved in the local memory of your browser. Using **"Commit History"**, you can revert a previous update. |
| <i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i> <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> <i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Validation Log | During the schema update process, a validation check is performed on whether the schema satisfies the validation conditions. Incompatible sections are marked and shown to the user. Pressing the **"Validation Log"** button displays the window listing all error, warning and information messages. |
| Search Field | Using this section, you can search fields and values. You can also enter search commands that include **Regular Expression**. |
| <i class="fas fa-minus-square"></i> Collapse All | Collapses all arrays in the schema content, so you can only expand fields, you want to edit. |
| <i class="fas fa-plus-square"></i> Expand All | You can click this link to expand all pre-collapsed arrays in the content. |
| <i class="fab fa-js-square"></i> Edit as JSON | You can click this link to edit the schema in JSON syntax. |

### Validation Page
Once the schema of the pattern is determined, it is necessary to specify the conditions applied to verify defined fields and parameters. In this way, you can guide users while they are creating their model based on your pattern. Also, you can make the necessary checks before the source code generation process. Error, warning, and information notes will be shown to users based on your conditions. Thus, you can provide a way for them to fix their invalid parameters and field values before the source code generation process.

| Section | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| <i class="fas fa-history"></i> Commit History | When you update the validation model, a copy of the validation model is saved in the local memory of your browser. Using **"Commit History"**, you can revert a previous update. |
| <i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i> <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> <i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Validation Log | During the validation model update process, a validation check is performed on whether the model satisfies the validation conditions. Incompatible sections are marked and shown to the user. Pressing the **"Validation Log"** button displays the window listing all error, warning and information messages. |
| Search Field | Using this section, you can search fields and values. You can also enter search commands that include **Regular Expression**. |
| <i class="fas fa-minus-square"></i> Collapse All | Collapses all arrays in the validation model content, so you can only expand fields, you want to edit. |
| <i class="fas fa-plus-square"></i> Expand All | You can click this link to expand all pre-collapsed arrays in the content. |
| <i class="fab fa-js-square"></i> Edit as JSON | You can click this link to edit the validation model in JSON syntax. |

### Files Page
In the source code generation phase, some files need to be added directly, without making any modifications to their content. These files are called static files. Using this section, you can create required directories and upload static files.

The files that you can upload in this section can be binary (image, audio, compressed) files, and text-based files. You can edit text-based files with the help of an integrated editor. Additionally, you can upload all static files as a single compressed .zip file, and then you can uncompress.

### Templates Page
One of the most important components of a pattern is templates. The templates are the micro-generators attached to pattern schema. Pyronome combines and runs these micro-generators while generating source code, according to the content of the model.

| Section | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| <i class="fas fa-history"></i> Commit History | When you update the template model, a copy of the template model is saved in the local memory of your browser. Using **"Commit History"**, you can revert a previous update. |
| <i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i> <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> <i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Validation Log | During the template model update process, a validation check is performed on whether the model satisfies the validation conditions. Incompatible sections are marked and shown to the user. Pressing the **"Validation Log"** button displays the window listing all error, warning and information messages. |
| <i class="fab fa-git-alt"></i> Repository | In some cases, it may be useful to store templates as files and update these files in a code repository. By clicking this button, you can specify a repository for the template files. |
| Pull & Compile! | If you specify a repository and it is enabled, click this button to pull and compile the template files. If a repository is not specified or not enabled, only compile operation is performed by clicking this button. |
| Search Field | Using this section, you can search fields and values. You can also enter search commands that include **Regular Expression**. |
| <i class="fas fa-minus-square"></i> Collapse All | Collapses all arrays in the template model content, so you can only expand fields, you want to edit. |
| <i class="fas fa-plus-square"></i> Expand All | You can click this link to expand all pre-collapsed arrays in the content. |
| <i class="fab fa-js-square"></i> Edit as JSON | You can click this link to edit the template model in JSON syntax. |
| <i class="fas fa-file-download"></i> Download | You can click this link to download the template files saved in the system. |

By clicking the **"Install Pattern(s)"** button, you can open the **"Install Pattern(s)"** window showing the possible pattern options that you can install to your pattern. With the help of this section, you can search for patterns according to your criteria and install the desired pattern(s), also purchase paid ones.

The list of installed patterns is in the middle of the page. You can sort patterns with special sorting grips to the left of each line. Additionally, with the version selector at the right of each line in the list, you can choose a specific version and perform a source code generation process based on this selected version.
